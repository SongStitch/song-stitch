// Package "owl" a go struct tag framework and algorithm driver.
// It provides algorithmic guidance through structured directives
// using Go struct tags. Users can design their own directives
// and register them to owl. Owl will run the directives on
// the struct fields in a depth-first manner. Which means it is
// suitable for data-binding algorithms, data validations, etc.
