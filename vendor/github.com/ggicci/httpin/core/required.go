// DirectiveRequired implements the "required" executor who indicates that the field must be set.
// If the field value were not set by former executors, errMissingField will be
// returned.
//
// NOTE: the "required" executor does not check the value of the field, it only checks
// if the field is set. In realcases, it's used to require that the key is present in
// the input data, e.g. form, header, etc. But it allows the value to be empty.
